      "message": "Hmm, they used to be the same when using the .32 kernel. If I understand correctly, using #include \"linux/msm_mdp.h\" means include a file in the same dir, but there\u0027s no linux/msm_mdp.h in this dir here. And in this case, using #include \u003clinux/msm_mdp.h\u003e will use the bionic one. I think the typo is from when I tested with a local msm_mdp.h, but then I reverted to the bionic one with adding linux/ but forgot to remove the parentheses. Do you recommend I copy the kernels msm_mdp.h to here, and include it so they both match?",
